# Book-Recommendation-System

Book Recommendation System using Apache Spark
This project implements a scalable book recommendation system using Apache Spark's MLlib library. The recommendation system employs collaborative filtering techniques, specifically the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm, to provide personalized book suggestions based on user ratings and book metadata.

Features
*Scalable Data Processing: Processed and analyzed large-scale datasets, including millions of user ratings and book metadata, using PySpark, enabling efficient handling of big data for recommendation generation.

*Model Optimization: Utilized hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as cross-validation and grid search, to optimize model performance. Achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.82 on the validation set, indicating high prediction accuracy.

*Personalized Recommendations: Generated personalized book recommendations for each user based on their historical ratings, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

*Interactive Visualization: Integrated IPython for displaying book images alongside recommendations, providing users with a visually appealing and intuitive experience.

Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure the availability of user ratings and book metadata datasets. These datasets should be in a structured format, such as CSV, and contain necessary information such as user IDs, book IDs, and ratings.

Model Training: Use the provided Python script to train the recommendation model using Apache Spark's ALS algorithm. Tune hyperparameters as needed to optimize model performance.

Recommendation Generation: After training the model, use it to generate personalized book recommendations for users. These recommendations can be based on user-specific ratings or general top-N recommendations for all users.
